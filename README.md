# Bit by Bit

Hello there! Welcome to Bit By Bit. This is a personal project of mine, aimed at making technology accessible to everyone, one concept at a time.

# About

Bit By Bit is my attempt to distil complex tech concepts into digestible daily lessons. Whether you're just starting your tech journey, a seasoned developer, or just someone curious about tech, I hope Bit By Bit can help broaden your horizons. Each day, I'll serve you a new lesson, carefully designed and explained to make tech a little less intimidating.
